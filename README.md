## Usage

The site is building using the Ruby gem [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), with a build toolchain based on [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (which runs Jekyll, compiles the CSS, and serves the site with [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/)).

1. The first time you try to build the site, install the dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Build the site - just run `npm start`! (We'll automatically make sure Jekyll is installed with Bundler.)

3. Head to <http://localhost:4000>. The site will automatically be updated on screen when you make changes to the SASS files (in `_sass`) or the Jekyll source.
