  <p>Avios, part of International Airlines Group, run the leading loyalty currency used by British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and other top airlines.</p>
  
  <p>I joined the Collection Tribe as Tech Lead, working on new products to help members earn more Avios on their day-to-day spending.</p>

  <p>I worked on a number of projects, including:</p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li class="list-item"><b>The relaunch of the <a href="https://www.shopping.ba.com" target="_blank">British Airways</a> and <a href="https://estore.aerlingus.com" target="_blank">Aer Lingus</a> eStores</b>, which allows Avios collectors to earn points when they shop online with their favourite retailers (from ASOS to John Lewis). I led a team of developers, shaping the team culture and putting in place best practices in testing, monitoring and continuous integration.</li>
    <li class="list-item"><b>An upcoming integration with the challenger bank Monese</b>. I helped to define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), identify the integration points and support Monese's development team to deliver the initial integration within weeks.</li>
    <li class="list-item"><b>A new chatbot to streamline the experience of claiming "Missing Avios"</b></li>
  </ul>
