  <p>BA Redemption Finder helps collectors of British Airways' Avios to get the best value
    from their hard-earned miles.</p>

  <p>I came up with the idea for this product, and then built it and marketed it from
    scratch. Today, it has thousands of paying customers.
  </p>

  <p>Over 100 billion Avios points are collected per year by nearly 8 million
  collectors all over the world. But when you’re ready to spend your Avios on flights, things can get a little
  difficult:</p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li class="list-item">
      <b>
        The best redemptions are very difficult to get, so you’ll need to be checking
        every day (or more!):
      </b>

      The most popular seats disappear very quickly. BA can release seats at any time of day or night, so to get those perfect dates, you’ll need
      to check many times a day.
    </li>
    <li class="list-item">
      <b>If you’re flexible, there’s no easy way to see what’s available:</b>

      The BA website assumes you know where you want to go and when. You can't easily see what dates are available for a particular route, or where you could fly on a particular date.
    </li>
  </ul>

</a>

<div class="container u-marginBl">
  <p>BA Redemption Finder solves both of these problems:</p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li class="list-item">When you know where you want to go, we show you all of the availability on a single page, and can send you alerts as soon as seats become available</li>
    <li class="list-item">When you don't know where you want to go, we'll show you everything that's available on a map</li>

  </ul>

  <p>A basic version of the tool is available for free, but I charge £3 per month
    for <a href="https://baredemptionfinder.com" target="_blank">"Elite membership"</a>
    which offers hourly alerts and the "I don't know where I want to go" search feature.</p>

  <p>
    I've massively enjoyed gathering feedback on the tool (including an 8.9 rating
    on Trustpilot) and continuously iterating to make it more and more useful.
