  <p>BA Redemption Finder helps collectors of British Airways' Avios to get the best value
    from their hard-earned miles.</p>

  <p>I came up with the idea for this product, and then built it and marketed it from
    scratch.
  </p>

  <p>Over 100 billion Avios points are collected per year by nearly 8 million
  collectors all over the world
  (<a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MzMyMDYxfENoaWxkSUQ9LTF8VHlwZT0z&t=1&cb=635959587461578780" target="_blank">source</a>).
  But when you’re ready to spend your Avios on flights, things can get a little
  difficult:</p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li class="list-item">
      <b>
        The best redemptions are very difficult to get, so you’ll need to be checking
        every day (or more!):
      </b>

      The most popular seats disappear very quickly. This makes it nearly impossible to
      get the most valuable seats  —  for example from London to Johannesburg in First.
      BA can release seats at any time of day or night (for example when people cancel,
      or if there’s spare room on a flight), so to get those perfect dates, you’ll need
      to check many times a day.
    </li>
    <li class="list-item">
      <b>If you’re flexible, there’s no easy way to see what’s available:</b>

      The BA website lets you search for specific dates or see a month’s availability at
      a time. If you’re flexible on dates and just want to see when is available, you’ll
      be left clicking away for hours.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

</a>

<div class="container u-marginBl">
  <p>BA Redemption Finder solves both of these problems with:</p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li class="list-item">Automated alerts as soon as seats become available</li>
    <li class="list-item">All of the availability shown on a single page</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A basic version of the tool is available for free, but I charge £3 per month
    for <a href="https://baredemptionfinder.com" target="_blank">"Elite membership"</a>
    which offers hourly alerts, giving the user the best chance of getting the flights
    they're looking for.</p>

  <p>
    I've massively enjoyed gathering feedback on the tool (including an 8.9 rating
    on Trustpilot) and continuously iterating to make it more and more useful.
  </p>

  <p>It now reaches tens of thousands of users every month, with hundreds paying for the
    premium service.</p>
