  <p>At Duffel, I was one of the first engineers helping to build the next generation of travel booking infrastructure. Duffel provides APIs that allow travel companies to search, book, and manage flights from multiple airlines through a single, modern interface.</p>

  <p>I joined Duffel as one of the founding team members and helped scale the company from a small startup to processing millions of dollars in bookings for travel companies around the world.</p>

  <p>Working primarily in Elixir and Phoenix, I built core platform features, APIs, and integrations that allowed travel companies to access airline inventory and create seamless booking experiences for their customers.</p>
