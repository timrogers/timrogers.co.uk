  <p>I worked with them to build tools to better track their customers' experience once connecting them to a local supplier, sending clients an SMS a week after their work was completed to find out how they found the experience, allowing them to ensure the quality of their partners and the service they were providing to consumers.</p>

  <p>I also built them a customer support phone system, in line with the Nodephone tool which I built at GoCardless, a complete tool for managing inbound customer support calls.</p>

<p>I worked with top Australian frequent flyer site <a href="http://www.pointhacks.com.au">Point Hacks</a> to build a tool to help users to get the best value when transferring their air miles to other partners (for example spending them on online shopping).</p>

<p>Working in JavaScript, I built a tool backed by a Google Spreadsheet, allowing conversation rates and partners to be kept up to date extremely simply, providing an invaluable tool for point collectors.</p>
