  <p>RouteMap are a social enterprise seeking to help students work out what university course is right for them, working directly with top universities to deliver unique educational content.</p>

  <p>I helped the company build its first prototype in Ruby on Rails, gaining significant seed funding from Wayra Unltd, and taking part in a competition, iDEA, run by the Duke of York culminating in a reception at St James's Palace.</p>

  <p>During my studies and since, I've freelanced for the London School of Economics and Political Science's Government department, building software to aid in data collection and analysis for political science research.</p>

  <p>I contributed to <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0010414015621077" target="_blank">Hagemann, Hobolt and Wratil's 2016 paper "Government Responsiveness in the European Union: Evidence From Council Voting"</a>, building tools to speed research assistants' data collection on European Union legislation by scraping EU websites and automatically pulling out the most important information.</p>

  <p>Other contributions I made form the basis of future papers still to be published, including:</p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li class="list-item">research on decisions in the Council of the European Union, for which I wrote a tool to parse PDF releases using OCR technology and pull out key pieces of information</li>
    <li class="list-item">research on the impact of reading news on people's political opinions, for which I built a dummy news site with detailed behaviour tracking</li>
  </ul>

  <ul class="list">
    <li class="list-item">a Twilio-powered tool for requesting and managing callbacks from their customer support team</li>
    <li class="list-item">a new super-charged signup flow powered by the WHMCS and cPanel APIs</li>

    <li class="list-item">tools to better track their customers' experience after connecting them to a local supplier, using an SMS survey to gather data</li>
    <li class="list-item">a customer support phone system, in line with the Nodephone tool which I built at GoCardless, a complete tool for managing inbound customer support calls.</li>

  <p>I worked with top Australian frequent flyer site <a href="http://www.pointhacks.com.au">Point Hacks</a> to build a tool to help users to get the best value when transferring their air miles to other partners (for example spending them on online shopping).</p>

  <p>Working in JavaScript, I built a tool backed by a Google Spreadsheet, allowing conversation rates and partners to be kept up to date extremely simply, providing an invaluable tool for point collectors.</p>
