<div class="container">
  <p>At GoCardless, I designed and built solutions independently and in small teams in Ruby used to process over $1bn of payments per year.</p>

  <p>Over my six years at the company since joining as the fifth employee, I worked in a variety of roles, from running customer support to kicking off customer success to leading the partnerships team to being an engineer, on a huge range of projects.</p>

  <p>I scoped and delivered projects from start to finish, defining requirements and working with users internally and externally to perfect the end product.</p>
