excerpt: I built Reward Flight Finder from scratch, helping collectors of British
  Airways' Avios to get the best value from their hard-earned points. It grew the business to 10,000 paying subscribers and then sold it in early 2020.

  <p>Reward Flight Finder (formerly BA Redemption Finder) makes it it easy to get the most value from your British Airways Avios points.</p>

  <p>I came up with the idea for this product, and then built it and marketed it from
    scratch. I grew it to 10,000 paying customers, and then sold the business in early 2020.

  <p>Millions of people around the world collect hundreds of billions of Avios each year. But when you’re ready to spend your miles on flights, things can get a little difficult:</p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li class="list-item">
      <b>
        The best redemptions are very difficult to get, so you’ll need to be checking
        every day (or more!):
      </b>

      The most popular seats disappear very quickly. Airlines can release seats at any time of day or night, so to get those perfect dates, you’ll need
      to check many times a day.
    </li>
    <li class="list-item">
      <b>If you’re flexible, there’s no easy way to see what’s available:</b>

      Airline websites assume you know where you want to go and when. You can't easily see what dates are available for a particular route, or where you could fly on a particular date.
    </li>
  </ul>

<div class="container u-marginBl">
  <p>Reward Flight Finder solves both of these problems:</p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li class="list-item">When you know where you want to go, it shows you all of the availability on a single page, and can send you alerts as soon as seats become available</li>
    <li class="list-item">When you don't know where you want to go, it shows you everything that's available on a map</li>

  </ul>
</div>
