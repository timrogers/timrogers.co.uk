  <p>Reward Flight Finder (formerly BA Redemption Finder) makes it it easy to get the most value from your British Airways Avios points and Virgin Atlantic
  Flying Club miles.</p>

  <p>I came up with the idea for this product, and then built it and marketed it from
    scratch. Today, it has thousands of paying customers.
  </p>

  <p>Millions of people around the world collect hundreds of billions of points every year across their Avios and Virgin
  Atlantic Flying Club accounts. But when you’re ready to spend your miles on flights, things can get a little difficult:</p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li class="list-item">
      <b>
        The best redemptions are very difficult to get, so you’ll need to be checking
        every day (or more!):
      </b>

      The most popular seats disappear very quickly. Airlines can release seats at any time of day or night, so to get those perfect dates, you’ll need
      to check many times a day.
    </li>
    <li class="list-item">
      <b>If you’re flexible, there’s no easy way to see what’s available:</b>

      Airline websites assume you know where you want to go and when. You can't easily see what dates are available for a particular route, or where you could fly on a particular date.
    </li>
  </ul>

</a>

<div class="container u-marginBl">
  <p>Reward Flight Finder solves both of these problems:</p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li class="list-item">When you know where you want to go, we show you all of the availability on a single page, and can send you alerts as soon as seats become available</li>
    <li class="list-item">When you don't know where you want to go, we'll show you everything that's available on a map</li>

  </ul>

  <p>A basic version of the tool is available for free, but I charge £3 per month
    for <a href="https://rewardflightfinder.com/memberships" target="_blank">"Elite membership"</a>
    which offers hourly alerts and the "I don't know where I want to go" search feature.</p>

  <p>
    I've massively enjoyed gathering feedback on the tool (including an 8.9 rating
    on Trustpilot) and continuously iterating to make it more and more useful.
