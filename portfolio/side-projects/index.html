<div class="container u-marginBl">
  <p>Sold Near Me made it easy to track property prices near you, or where you're interested in purchasing.</p>

  <p>Users simply entered their postcode, email and how widely they wanted to search around the location, and then they received regular updates on prices.</p>

  <p>The service used open data from the Land Registry, Ordnance Service, Royal Mail and the Office of National Statistics.</p>

  <p>Sold Near me is no longer online.</p>

  <h3 id="lse-librarian" class="u-marginTl">LSE Librarian</h3>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>An app for students at the <a href="https://lse.ac.uk" target="_blank">London School of Economics and Political Science</a>, built when I was studying at the university, for renewing library books on the go.</p>

  <p>Originally, I built this app using Phonegap but since then, I re-built it in native Objective-C, with new functionality and a way better experience.</p>

  <p>The app is no longer available, with LSE having threatened legal action if I did not take it down.</p>
