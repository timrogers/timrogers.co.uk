  <p>From mid-2016 to mid-2017, I worked one day a week pro bono for <a href="https://www.uccf.org.uk" target="_blank">UCCF: The Christian Unions</a>, the charity which supports Christian Unions in universities across Great Britain.</p>

<div class="container u-marginBl">
  <p>I helped them to build a new, discrete authentication service, based on the OAuth specification, to allow UCCF's thousands of users to use their accounts outside of the main website.</p>

  <p>This will make it possible for the organisation to move from a single monolith PHP application to discrete services and sites for different needs.</p>
